## About Me
I've coded various programs in languages like C#, Python, JavaScript, and more.
My preffered language for applications is C#. In the past I used to code a lot of windows applications,
but recently I've started to expand my interests in websites and web apps, as well as some other console
applications that focus on computing, which I usually write in python.
